Essential system communication breakdown:
1) Client(s) connect to the server
2) Clients interact with one another(?)
3) they both have to "constantly" be waiting for the screen usage

Client:
1. a
2. Create 2 windows
3. Set up signal handling for calling the readlog from server
4. Wait till user inputs or 1 sec has passed
5. If client enters message, send to server. Server will update log.
